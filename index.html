        UBC WICS aims to build a strong community of women in Computer
        Science at UBC. We seek to empower women by providing opportunities
        to build lasting connections with other women in tech, and
        supporting each other as we progress through our time at UBC!

          Enigmatic, impactful, dynamic, exciting, revolutionary are all words I’d use to describe what Computer Science means to me. I was first introduced to coding in Grade 9 in high school. As much as I loved coding, I could never really understand how writing code could help me create social impact which I wanted from myself at the end of the day. I soon realized that CS deals with human-related problems just like any other field. It is a never-ending journey of learning and growth. The versatility and problem-solving aspect of CS never fail to amaze me. In my role as the President of UBC Women in CS, I aim to provide an opportunity to foster a welcoming community of women in tech. 
Though UBC’s CS department organized tons of career events, throughout my freshman year, I wondered if we had a community of women in tech at UBC, a community that helped uplift each other and could grow together both professionally and socially. Right into my sophomore year, I decided to start a “Women in Computer Science” group at UBC. Coincidentally, I met Daphne and Sophie, who were planning to work on the exact same thing! Right then, I decided to join both of them to help build a welcoming and inclusive community of women in CS. I am glad to be a part of such an awesome community and privileged to represent them as the President of UBC Women in Computer Science!  In the end, as clichéd as it might sound, the BIGGEST advice that I’d ever give to anyone would be to “Step out of your comfort zone, meet new people, make lasting connections, take initiatives, face challenges, dare to take risks, make your own way into the world, a way that is uniquely designed for you, by you.” My experience as an international student at such a wonderful university as UBC has completely turned me around and I am sure, these experiences you create for yourself would turn you around too!

          I stumbled into Computer Science because of bubble tea. Two years ago, I was a pre-pharmacy student delivering
          bubble tea to a friend at a hackathon. I opened my eyes to see the participants transforming ideas into
          prototypes and conjuring projects out of thin air. I decided to try it myself and took an elective. Despite
          some doubts, I pushed myself to keep going. I won a hackathon, spoke at a conference, and interned at Yelp,
          Shopify and Hootsuite. My passion was set ablaze, but I was never able to shake the feeling that I was alone
          as a latecomer.
          Then, I met a group of like-minded women from UBC at Grace Hopper Conference. I felt invigorated and realized
          that I had never met them on campus. The CS Department facilitated many career events, but I wanted to see
          more community building events.
          Many other universities have a Women in CS club, so I thought 'What if I start one at UBC?' I bounced the idea
          off Margo, Cinda and Michele. They provided immense support and Margo connected me with her former students
          who founded Harvard Women in CS. My friends and I channeled the spirit of hackathons and brought our ambition
          to fruition. We're starting to see more engagement around the campus from our events. We're committed to do
          more. Our vision is to provide resources and mentorship to foster personal growth and make this sense of
          community long-lasting.</p>

          I first-hand experienced what it is like to be one of the only girls in technology-related courses in
          high-school, like many of our members. I always knew that computer science and technology was my passion
          though, and new that it was what I wanted to pursue. I wanted to create UBC WiCS as space where women int
          technology can build a community at UBC, and encourage each other to pursue their passions, even if it may be
          hard some times. UBC WiCS is not just a place for females that are already passionate about technology
          however, it is also a place where females can feel security and support if they want to gain their first
          experiences in these fields and explore what computer science has to offer. One aspect I feel strongly about
          is that UBC WiCS does focus on building a strong community around females, however, this should not come at
          the cost of excluding others, as only by integrating and experiencing with each other can we make a real
          difference.

          As a lost high school student, I had a hard time knowing which subject would be for me once I got into the
          terrifying world that is university. Rather than possibly choosing computer science because I wanted to, I
          choose computer science because I wouldn’t have been happy doing anything else. There was no other subject
          that seemed to quite fit. I loved logic and the joy that comes from figuring out a difficult problem, yet
          could never stay away from anything that involved creativity. My hope in joining WiCS is to create a
          supportive community so that everyone, especially the minorities, in tech could find their place and feel
          welcomed. As one of your communications directors I can’t wait to see what the future will hold for this

          When I started my undergrad, I would never have guessed where I would be today. At the beginning of first
          year, I was certain I would be a bio major. By second year, I had decided that chemistry was better suited for
          me and chose it for my major. That year, I also took a computer science class as an elective and found a
          passion I never would have expected. In my final year now, I am finishing my degree with a combined major in
          Computer Science and Chemistry. One of the things I love about Computer Science is being able to solve diverse
          and challenging problems. I am beyond thrilled to have such an amazing community of women in computer science
          at UBC who constantly inspire me.

          I started coding when I was 15 as I discovered a blogging platform that allows you to edit your blog with
          HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Every weekend, I would spend hours in front of my computer, looking up specific
          features for my blog. I actually had no idea what I was doing; I was definitely not aware that I was in fact
          coding! All I knew was that it was fascinating to me because I could build a website by simply typing out some
          texts in a certain format.
          Back then, just like any other first years, I was full of enthusiasm and was looking forward to meet more
          people I could interact and learn with. All was good until I realized how the female-to-male ratio in CS major
          was significantly low compared to the other majors. Surprised by this reality, I didn’t want to neglect it,
          but rather wanted to make a change. I wanted to establish a permanent place for women in CS at UBC, where
          women can feel like they have a place to go to whenever they feel a bit lost - like how I used to feel all the
          time. I started to think about why there were not many women compared to men, and I realized that exposure to
          this field was the crucial factor. I honestly would not have picked CS as my major if I hadn't found that
          blogging website back then - it was my only exposure to CS. No one around me, my friends nor my family, were
          in this field. Thus, I believe our WICS team will establish a sense of community for women in CS at UBC by
          creating more women focused social events, career developing events, along with outreach programs for younger
          girls out there, letting them know there's space for them in the technology and engineering fields.

          Before studying Computer Science at UBC, I was a student at the University of Calgary studying Biological Sciences and
          Sociology (yes - I know that's an unusual combination :) ). I worked in a Cancer Epidemiology lab at the time and it was here that I was first exposed to the work that
          programmers and data scientists were performing to help make everyone else's work operate more smoothly.
          After obtaining my BSc. and BA, I decided I wanted to learn how to code and develop software myself and so I decided to enroll in the Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) after-degree program at UBC. I wanted to join UBC WICS as soon as I heard about it because I want to help foster a
          more collaborative and supportive community of computer science students of all genders at UBC. I have found that being able to seek out and surround myself with other women in tech, has made me feel supported and capable and this has made all the difference in my ability to learn and
          take advantage of the many opportunities the CS department offers.

        <p id="mission-statement">
          If you’d asked me in my senior year of high school what I wanted to major in, I’d say a mix of either liberal
          arts, literature, business, environmental science, or computer science. It mostly depended on the day and my
          mood. Being in computer science sounded as far away and difficult as being a doctor— did I really believe I
          could be successful? Did I have the work ethic, the drive, and the skills? And even if I did— would I want to
          put in the work? Most of the time, my answer was ‘no’ either because of self-doubt or belief that being a
          software engineer was grueling. However, now in college, I can’t see another major that would capture my
          curiosity, intellectual drive, or need to latch onto something fulfilling and challenging. I think being in CS
          has really taught me the value of small, incremental improvements and the ability to change one’s destiny.
          There is something empowering about doing something difficult and becoming better as a result. I’m so glad I
          get to be a part of UBC WiCs and encourage others that anyone can learn to code. Empowerment, confidence, and
          competence are valuable traits I feel WiCs inspires in all future coders.</p>

        <p id="mission-statement">
          Hi I'm Paulette, a first year master's student working on type-preserving compilation of dependent types with
          Professor WIlliam J. Bowman. I'm from a tiny town in Indiana, USA, and I decided to pursue computer science at
          Indiana University because I was inspired by my older sister who is a software developer. During my time at
          IU, I got really interested in programming languages theory and research, and that's how I ended up at UBC. I
          plan to pursue my PhD at UBC as well and become a professor of computer science. I'm especially motivated
          because I never had a female professor teach me a computer science course whose research area was programming
          languages! Furthermore, as I got farther along in my degree, I found that I was the only woman in my computer
          science courses. By being a part of UBC Women in CS, I hope to help foster a nurturing and encouraging
          environment for all women interested in computer science. I definitely wouldn't be where I am today without
          some of my female friends in my intro courses in computer science, and I hope that UBC Women in CS can be an
          additional support network for women outside the classroom!

          I first fell in love with coding in a high school computer science course. I loved how it challenged me to
          think in different ways, and the satisfaction I found in solving a complex problem is one of the most
          rewarding feelings ever. At the same time as I fell in love with coding, I also found environmental science.
          The pressing issue of climate change encouraged me to combine majors in computer science and environmental
          science, in hopes of bridging the gap between the tech industry and climate research. I’m in my second year
          now, with plans to graduate in 2023 after my co-op work terms. I am so excited to be apart of the WiCS board,
          I see this group as an opportunity to help other women find their passions in university and build a
          supportive environment within the computer science department, and I hope that by planning fun and informative
          events I can help us can achieve these goals! </p>

          Hi! I’m Michelle, the treasurer and a first year Business & Computer Science student. I definitely wasn’t
          someone who was a natural coder, my path dwindled and turned. Although I’m learning Java right now, I think my
          main interest is I Human Computer Interaction, UI/UX design and data analytics! Super interested to meet
          others who are passionate in these areas, and looking forward to be a more active member in the Cs community!
          Always feel free to reach out to me if you need a new friend, or someone to join hackathons and other business
          and tech focused events! :)

          My name is Parinaz (Paris) Khoramziadeh and I am the marketing coordinator/volunteer for the WiCS. I come from
          an interesting background, having the opportunity to try different majors such as Engineering, Biology and
          sciences, I finally found my dream and passion for robotics and programming. I am a Psychology and
          Mathematicians major switching to CS and Math and my goal is to help people all over the world through
          technology and A.I. I aspire to help and uplift them by crafting machines and robots that will make their
          lives much easier. My love for robotics started when I competed in an international event designed for
          providing a platform for hard working students with big dreams. I felt accomplished and proud to have been
          selected among my other peers as representatives from my school and it was that moment when I realized that I
          can use my talents and creativity in such a meaningful and empowering way. I look forward to contributing my
          knowledge and ideas to WiCS and CODE in order to continue the legacy of all the amazing role models in the
          STEM field who have paved the way for us and inspired many to follow their dreams and create a fun,
